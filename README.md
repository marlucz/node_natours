# node.js Natours Project
My work along with Jonas Schmedtmann's node.js course. 

My main point in taking this course was to better understand backend technologies in JavaScript and be able to write simple serveres for my frontend projects.

## What I got familiar with: 
- CRUD operations 
- REST API architecture
- Express framework 
- NoSQL MongdoDB 
- Routing, Middlewares
